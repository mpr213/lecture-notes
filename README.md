## Fundamentals
### Must be in Place to Pass
1. Names, Objects and Assignment
2. Importing Modules and Usage
3. Functions (Using Existing, Creating Custom)
4. Basic Structures (For-Loop, While-Loop, If-Statements)
5. Basic Arrays and Lists (Usage, Iterating Over, Growing)
6. Basic Plotting

### Need to Ensure
1. Tests and Exams Outcomes --> Only pass when above fundamentals are in place
2. Teaching Outcomes --> Align with the fundamentals
3. Tutorials Outcomes --> Align with the fundamentals
4. Basic and advanced / extra outcomes --> Make sure that advanced / extra
   outcomes do not interfere with basic outcomes - when in doubt throw it out!
